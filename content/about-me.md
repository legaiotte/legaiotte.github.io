⚡ Fun fact: During my secondary school I completed an associate's degree in programming, I had contact with the Pascal/JAVA language, databases and basic notions of computer operation. Thereafter, I decided to pursue a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in Biology. This knowledge helped me stand out in my field. This year, I decided to invest more time in learning about the data approach. I hope my scientist mindset will help me pursue this goal. I'm a curious person who loves to keep learning and make great discoveries. It's great to have you here, welcome!
